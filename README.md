This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving dangling pointers and vector reallocation. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to modify a vector through a raw pointer after the vector has been reallocated.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version using safe Rust methods. This example highlights the importance of understanding memory management and avoiding unsafe code unless absolutely necessary.
